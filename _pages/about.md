# About me
I'm a PhD student at Bar-Ilan University, I'm co-supervised by Professors Ido Dagan and Yoav Goldberg. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, and more specifically in semantics and information decomposition.

Specificaly, I study how different [events and entities mentioned in text relate to each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_role_labeling). I'm especially interested in relations that are not overtly stated in the text but are commonly understood by reading it. 
Such relations are often termed as <i>implicit</i>, and while they may seem quite obvious to our human perception, tend to be more difficult to comprehend for machines. 

On a broader aspect, I'm interested in [decomposing information expressed in text into minimal units](https://qasrl.org/) that can be worked with and composed back for various applications. I'm exploring ways that a fine-grained information decomposition scheme can be utilized for robust machine comprehension, summarization and entailment.
